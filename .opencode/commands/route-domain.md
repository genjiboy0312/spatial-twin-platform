# route-domain

Use this local command from the repo root as a documentation-only intake router for the local bundle. Keep it thin. Classify the request, name the best local route, and defer the full routing logic to `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md`.

## Intent

1. Capture the dominant request shape in one of the six fixed buckets.
2. Point to the primary local pack, deferring adjacent-pack specifics to `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md`.
3. Suggest that the recommended starting category comes from the matrix, not from this command.
4. Point helper and browser-helper discovery back to the matrix instead of reproducing helper fit locally.
5. Remind the operator of support and workspace boundaries without widening them.

## Output contract

Return a short routing note with these fields:

| Field | What to include |
| --- | --- |
| bucket | One of the six fixed routing buckets |
| pack(s) | Primary local pack, with any adjacent-pack nuance deferred to `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` |
| category | Recommended starting category from `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md`, treated as the first lane to try rather than a permanent lock |
| helpers | Only a brief helper note if needed, with helper and browser-helper discovery deferred to `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` |
| support caveat | Routing is not support authority. Current `validated`, `guided`, and `planned` authority stays in `.opencode/reference/capability-matrix.json`, `.opencode/reference/support-policy.md`, and `.opencode/reference/workflow-catalog.md` |
| workspace note | `existing project in place` or `greenfield -> workspace/{project-name}-{domain}` |

## Routing rules

1. Treat categories as recommended starting points.
2. Treat `unspecified-low` and `unspecified-high` as fallback-only categories when no better named lane fits.
3. Keep support authority separate from routing.
4. Keep workspace guidance documentation-only.
5. Do not restate helper tables, browser-helper discovery, adjacent-pack routing logic, or planned adjacent-pack listings outside the matrix.

## Authoritative source

Use `.opencode/reference/routing-matrix.md` as the authoritative local routing and helper source. Read that matrix for the full bucket map, pack mapping, recommended starting category guidance, helper and browser-helper discovery, adjacent-pack guidance including planned adjacent references, fallback handling, and workspace reminders.
